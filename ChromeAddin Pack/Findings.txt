Q : Analyze and identify the root cause of the issue with Chrome version 130.  
	
	After updating chrome to 130, the app is receiving the parameter as ofs://http//{Url} missing the colon (:) between http and //. 
	Previously the URL was forwarded as is, without alterations ofs://http://{Url}.
	Recent chrome update misinterpreting the link.
	changing http// to http:// or https// to https:// can provide fix for chrome 130 Version.


Q : Explore alternatives (third-party libraries, JavaScript libraries, or revised protocol handling). 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

Three alternative approaches—with their pros and cons—that avoid relying solely on traditional custom protocol handlers:

1. Revised Protocol Handling with JavaScript Libraries

	Examples: updated versions or forks of custom-protocol-check and libraries like deeplink.js

	How It Works:  
	These libraries attempt to launch native applications using custom URI schemes, but they include improved detection logic and fallbacks to account for browser changes (such as stricter URL parsing in Chrome).

	Pros:
	- Minimal Changes:  
	  Can be integrated into existing web pages with minimal modifications.
	- Built-in Fallbacks:  
	  Often includes logic to detect if the app isn’t installed and redirect users to a download page.
	- Cross-Browser:  
	  Works across multiple browsers if the library is well maintained.

	Cons:
	- Reliance on Custom URI Schemes:  
	  Still depends on custom protocols, which can be subject to future browser restrictions or parsing issues.
	- Inconsistent Behavior:  
	  Different browsers may interpret the custom URI scheme in slightly different ways.
	- Maintenance Overhead:  
	  May require ongoing updates to handle changes in browser behavior.



2. Browser Extension with Native Messaging

	How It Works:  
	A browser extension intercepts user actions (such as clicks on links with a custom scheme) and uses the browser’s native messaging API to send a message to a locally installed helper application. The native host then launches the ClickOnce (or native) application.

	Pros:
	- Robust and Secure:  
	  Leverages standardized browser APIs and explicit user permissions, reducing reliance on fragile URL parsing.
	- Bypasses Custom Protocol Issues:  
	  Directly communicates with the native host, avoiding many quirks associated with custom URI schemes.
	- Future-Proof:  
	  Extensions are actively maintained by browsers (Chrome, Edge, Firefox) and support modern security practices.

	Cons:
	- User Installation Required:  
	  Users must install the extension, which can introduce friction.
	- Dual Components:  
	  Requires maintaining both the browser extension and the native messaging host.
	- Browser-Specific Packaging:  
	  Although most modern browsers use similar APIs, some minor modifications may be needed for full cross-browser support.



 3. Local HTTP/REST API Approach

	How It Works:  
	The native application runs a small local HTTP server (or REST API) that listens on a designated localhost port. When a user clicks a link in the web page, JavaScript (using AJAX or the Fetch API) sends an HTTP request to the local server, which then processes the request (e.g., launching the ClickOnce application).

	Pros:
	- Standards-Based:  
	  Uses standard HTTP protocols that are universally supported by browsers.
	- Browser-Agnostic:  
	  Works the same across all modern browsers without relying on custom URI schemes.
	- Easier Debugging:  
	  HTTP requests are easier to monitor and debug using standard developer tools.

	Cons:
	- Requires a Running Local Server:  
	  The native application must continuously run a local server, which may raise concerns about resource usage and security.
	- Port and Firewall Management:  
	  May require handling port conflicts and ensuring that firewall settings allow local communication.
	- Latency:  
	  Although typically minimal, there might be a slight delay in processing HTTP requests compared to direct invocation.


Conclusion

	Each approach offers a way to avoid relying on traditional custom protocol handlers:

		- Revised JavaScript libraries can quickly update existing implementations but still depend on custom schemes.
		- Browser extensions with native messaging offer a robust and secure solution with explicit user control and are well-supported by modern browsers.
		- Local HTTP/REST API approach leverages standard web protocols for a browser-agnostic solution, though it introduces the need for a continuously running local server.
